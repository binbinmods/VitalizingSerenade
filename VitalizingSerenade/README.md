# Vitalizing Serenade

This is a simple mod that fundamentally replaces the NPCs in acts 2 and 3 with fishier ones.

It also has the option of increasing the number of fishing rods you get, replacing some card rewards with fish, and giving you random bonus fish every turn.

This has not been tested in multiplayer yet, so let me know if there are any issues!
