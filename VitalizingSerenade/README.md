# Vitalizing Serenade

This mod makes Vitalizing Serenade more prominant, and potentially better.

This mod is supposed to do the following:

1. Buff Vitalizing Serenade
2. Add 2 Vitalizing Serenades to everyone's deck
3. Make Vitalizing Serenade completely unremovable
4. Add additional Vitalizing Serenades to the card rewards/craft pool
5. Make Vitalizing Serenade more common as card rewards
6. Add a bunch of Vitalizing Serenade themed items
7. Change the name of everything to Vitalizing Serenade

Additionally, if you run into a bug where the game freezes on card rewards, set "EnableRandomSerenades" to be false. That should fix the issue.

This has not been tested in multiplayer yet, so let me know if there are any issues! Note: there are likely to be a good number of them.
